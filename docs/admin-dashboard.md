# Admin Dashboard Documentation

## Overview

The Admin Dashboard is a powerful interface for managing all aspects of the social network. It provides tools for user management, content moderation, site configuration, and analytics.

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All admin endpoints require authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced
3. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are rate-limited
4. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions are logged
5. **CSRF Protection**: Enabled for all forms
6. **CORS**: Strictly configured

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Can't access admin dashboard**
   - Verify user has admin role
   - Check authentication status
   - Verify JWT token is valid

2. **Changes not saving**
   - Check for validation errors
   - Verify database connection
   - Check server logs

3. **Slow performance**
   - Check database indexes
   - Review query performance
   - Consider caching

## Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege**: Only grant admin access to trusted users
2. **Audit Logs**: Regularly review admin actions
3. **Backup**: Regular database backups
4. **Updates**: Keep the application and dependencies up to date
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerts
